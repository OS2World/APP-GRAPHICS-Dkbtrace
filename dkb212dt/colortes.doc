    Files:
        COLORTST.GIF..... 320x200 image displaying colors from COLOR.DAT
        COLORTST.KEY..... Text file describing COLORTST.GIF
        COLORTST.DAT..... DKB script used to create COLORTST.GIF
        COLORS.DAT....... In case you don't have this already.

I put together this package because I figured if it was helpful to me, it
may be helpful for others.  Mike J. Schoenborn started this project when he
wrote a text file, included in a raytracer called MTV, that described
the color proportions for a veritable rainbow of hues and shades.  Then
came Lee Lifschiz who compiled the list into an include-able data file for
the DKB Ray Trace program that we have come to love (thanks, David and Aaron!).
COLORTST.GIF is just my small way of contributing.  I wanted to be able to
see the colors, rather than just imagining them.  So, I put together this
image of "color-chips".  Hope it helps.

Incidentally, the data file, of course, can be re-used to test other
attributes, too.  Try various values for PHONG or SPECTRAL, for example.
Or, "checker" the background and test REFRACTION (be prepared for a LONG
wait, however).  And... UPLOAD THE RESULTS so we can all share!
