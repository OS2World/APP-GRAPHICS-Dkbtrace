Note on data files:

Some of these data files specify GIF or IFF image maps.  In order to prevent
the data file archive from becoming too huge, I've not included these images
except in special cases where the exact picture does matter.  For the other
files, please feel free to substitute the image with one of your own choice.
You should be able to get lots of interesting pictures from BBS'es or the
computer networks.
